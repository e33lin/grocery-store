# Smart Cart

This rails app is to allow users the ability to input their grocery list for recommendations on the cheapest grocery stores to shop at!

## Running Locally

### Pre-requisite

Ensure that you have Ruby installed on your machine. If you are on a Mac, it is recommended to install a "second" Ruby instead of running Rails apps with the Ruby that came installed with your Mac. To double check if you have a "second" Ruby installed, you can follow this guide: https://mac.install.guide/ruby/9.html

(you can install Ruby however you want, I personally went with using homebrew as I already have used homebrew before: https://mac.install.guide/ruby/13.html)

You also need PostgreSQL installed: https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-postgresql-on-a-mac-with-homebrew-and-lunchy/
